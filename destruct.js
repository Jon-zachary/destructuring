// Store the following values located in the above `goldfish` object into variables, with names of your choice. Each prompt must be completed on one line and using array/object destructuring...
// - "Gustave" and "Telescope"

// - "Weddings" and "Scandal" 

// - The entire `brian` and `ziggy` objects

// - "Red Wine" and "Chuck Mangione" 


// Write a function that takes our goldfish object and console logs 'My name is [goldfish.name] and I have a weakness for [goldfish.weaknesses[0]]' using destructuring.


// Write a function that calculates the volume of a box with a height a width and a depth.
// write the function using es6 defaults with height,width and depth equal to 10.


// Create an array [1,2,3,4,5]. Using array destructuring create variables first and
// fifth and set them equal to the first and fifth value of the array. 
// Next create two variables second and fourthFifth and set second equal to the second element of the 
// array and fourthFifth equal to the fourth and fifth elements of the array using the rest operator.
// Remember to do these on one line each.
